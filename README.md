# MPhil-study-1-effects-of-SOI-and-SDO-on-moralisation-of-female-promiscuity

In this study, participants were asked to complete measures assessing their sociosexuality (SOI; behavours, attitudes, and desires regarding sex without emotional commitment), social dominance orientation (SDO; support for social hierarchies), and moralisation of promiscuty in both men and women. The goal was to test to what degree SOI and SDO predict moralisation, particularly of promiscuity in women. Evolutionary theory would mostly argue the main predictor is people's individual mating strategies, whereas feminist theory would argue it is desire for social hierarchies that place women as submissive or "inferior" to men. 

Consistent with past studies, men were generally more moralising of women promiscuity (although exploratory analyses showed men were more moralising of promiscuity in general, whereas women were *less* moralising of promiscuty among women than they were of promiscuity among men, suggesting women hold a sexual double standard). Path analyses suggest SOI (especially attitudes) and SDO only partially mediate sex differences in the moralistion of promiscuous women. Altogether, a partial mediatio model explained about 43% of the variation in the moralistion of promiscuity among women.
